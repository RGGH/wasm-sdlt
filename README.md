# Build a simple web application using Rust and Web Assembly.

# Create a Rust Project
  cargo new tax-calc-wasm
  cd tax-calc-wasm

# Step 2: Writing the Rust Code
Edit src/lib.rs to implement the tax calculation logic:
```rust
// Importing wasm_bindgen crate to enable communication between JavaScript and Rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

// Define the function that will be exposed to JavaScript
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn xyz () {
}
```

# Step 3: Building the Project
Build the project using wasm-pack:
```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

# Step 4: Setting Up the Web Environment
Create an index.html file in the tax-calculator-wasm directory 
# Step 5: Serving the Project

To serve the project, you need a simple web server.
## http-server

http-server .
Navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser to see the tax calculator in action.
